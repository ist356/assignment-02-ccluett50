## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

This assignment, based on my skills, was more of a recollection of previous python skills than new material as we are still ramping up class skills. I struggled most with the first function and the last 2 were very easy as they were based on the first. The syntax for splitting was a little confusing, but after reading upon it, I knew that I needed 2 parts to split the "in" part of the sentences into 2. However, I then struggled as it was showing 2 items, one singular and one plural, causing most of my tests to error. I then thought it would be important to make a function that loops over the list items and compare, and if the two items match, remove the singular object or first part of the list. This then made my function work. This was the most difficult part of the assignment, but using my blank file, I was able to think through the proper process of acheiving a normal output. This assignment also helped me practice vscode committing, testing, and debugging. As I need these processes going forward, I am happy that I am learning quickly. Overall, this code helped me recall the importance of making functions build on each other, and splitting strings to manipulate lists in a JSON format.

Part two of reflection: I did not realize until after that there was two parts and had to write to a json file with data. I struggled at first with this and kept getting value errors in my function. I soon realize that the data had an issue or typo so I corrected it then it ran. I understand the process of taking a text file, splitting by line and then performing all functions before writing back in a json format. This was confusing at first as I has some issues with writing correctly. Copilot helped to fix the errors. I forgot that I needed "w" to write and this is a good review from 256. This part did not take as long but was fairly newer material that I was less confident in.
